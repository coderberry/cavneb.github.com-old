Here are several screencasts that I did for [TeachMeToCode.com](http://teachmetocode.com/screencasts/tag/grails)

## [Introduction to Grails – Part 1](http://teachmetocode.com/screencasts/introduction-to-grails-part-1/) ##
Are you new to Grails? Grails is an excellent alternative to Ruby on Rails, which uses Groovy / Java. In this screencast, learn how to create a simple CRUD system with Grails.

## [Introduction to Grails – Part 2](http://teachmetocode.com/screencasts/introduction-to-grails-part-2/) ##
In this screencast, we continue on our task of creating a ‘Stack Overflow’ clone by adding more domain classes and relationships between them. We also cover how to test your classes using integration tests.

## [Skinning in Grails](http://teachmetocode.com/screencasts/skinning-in-grails/) ##
In this screencast, I cover how to use custom Grails configurations along with filters to enable url-based site skins.
