## Ruby on Rails

Ever since mid 2007, I have been involved with the ruby and rails community. Since then, I have developed quite a bit and hopefully contributed back some.

## Groovy & Grails

In 2009, my brother and I started working on projects that required use of Java libraries. JRuby wasn't mature enough at the time, so we started using Groovy & Grails. It was the right decision.

## Mobile Development

After having some success with some apps I wrote for the android market, I quickly fell in love with the idea of developing for mobile devices.

## Game Development

I have been spending a lot of time lately with friends trying to break into the game development industry. In the short period of time, I found that developing games is not as much of a 'black art' as I thought it was.
